    "Question": "What is the next best step in the management of this patient?",
    "History": "Patient was found to have a Right Upper Lobe Adenocarcinoma. He underwent Right Upper Lobe Lobectomy and systematic mediastinal lymph node dissection. Pathology demonstrated a 2.2 cm tumor of adenocarcinoma histology with negative margins. Additionally, there were no visceral pleural invasion and none of the dissected lymph nodes were positive for carcinoma",
    "Choice_A": "Check for PD-L1 ",
    "Choice_B": "Check EGFR mutation status",
    "Choice_C": "4 cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy",
    "Choice_D": "Active surveillance ",
    "Correct_answer": "Choice_D",
    "Answer_details": "d. Active surveillance. Patient has pT1c pN0 (stage IA3 ; AJCC 8th Edition Staging System). These patients are often followed with a CT chest every 6 months.",

    "Question": "What will be the most appropriate recommendation for this patient?",
    "History": "Patient was found to have a Right Lower Lobe Adenocarcinoma of the Lung. She underwent Left Lower Lobectomy and systemic mediastinal lymph node dissection. Pathology revealed a  2.9 cm tumor of adenocarcinoma histology with negative margins. There was no visceral pleural involvement but one of the intrapulmonary nodes was positive for carcinoma. PD-L1 expression in tumor cells by SP263 was 100%.",
    "Choice_A": "Active surveillance ",
    "Choice_B": "4 cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy",
    "Choice_C": "4 cycles of cisplatin-pemetrexed followed by atezolizumab",
    "Choice_D": "4 cycles of cisplatin-pemetrexed and check for EGFR mutation status",
    "Correct_answer": "Choice_D",
    "Answer_details": "d. Patient has a 2.9 cm tumor with an intrapulmonary node making it a T1c N1 (stage IIB) disease. She will benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy (OS benefit). Additionally, if EGFR-mutant NSCLC, she will also benefit from adjuvant osimertinib (DFS benefit) based on ADAURA trial. In the absence of EGFR mutation, after receiving adjuvant chemotherapy, given the high expression of PD-L1, adjuvant atezolizumab is recommended (DFS benefit) based on the  IMPower-010 trial. We strongly recommend checking for driver mutation before recommending adjuvant immunotherapy.",
